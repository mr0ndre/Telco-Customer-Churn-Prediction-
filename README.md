# Customer Churn Analysis (PLANNING STAGE)

## 1. Project Overview


This project aim to understand why customers choose to discontinue with the service. By using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) technique, key factors and patterns that influence churn are identified. Machine Learning models are then implemented to determine whether customers is at "high risk", "moderate risk, "low risk" of churning. 

         
## 2. Business Objective

Customer Churn: 

One of the major concern with businesses is when customers discontinues to use the service provided by the company. This will greatly imact revenue. Understanding the key factors and patterns that lead to customer churn is therefore critical. By analyzing these patterns, businesses can develop retention strategies to maintain healthy revenue streams.  
 

The primary objective of this project is to reduce customer churn by forecasting customers with high risk of leaving, using a machine learning model, and providing actionable recommendations to improve retention.

### Data Description
The dataset contains 7,043 observations with 33 variables describing customer demographics, service usage, contract information, billing details, and churn-related metrics.

The target variable indicates whether a customer churned during the quarter. Additional variables include customer tenure, contract type, monthly charges, service subscriptions, and customer value metrics such as churn score and customer lifetime value (CLTV).

Feature definitions and dataset documentation are based on the original description provided by the dataset author on Kaggle.
